LR parsing based calculators
----------------------------

eexp - evaluates expressions directly (portable)
cexp - jit compiles expressions (x86-64 only)

If you want cexp to print the code generated, you
have to install the udis86 library, uncomment one
line in the Makefile and make sure the include in
cexp.c is valid.
